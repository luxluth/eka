= COMPUTE METHOD STRATEGY

For now the computing is really poorly designed
The idea is the following : request/complete-later (RCL)

The idea is simple. Once the furtherest children reached if all required
attributes are there to compute the space, it's done right away else we
aggregate the action and perform them later.
Resolve what can be computed (enough information to do so) and aggregate
what cannot computed.
After aggregate. We can check for condition of unaggregation.
For example.

Parent A -> (Child A, Child B -> (Child B A))
Parent has 800x600 dimension
Child A wants to be 50% in height of the parent A
Child B wants to fill the remaining space
But Child B A want to fit his parent dimension

1 At Parent A
2  -> At Child A (has all info) => take half height of the parent
3  -> At Child B
4     -> At Child B A (x. Do not know the dimension of the parent) => Saves need Parent dimension
5     Compute his dimension (has all info) => take remaining 50%
6     => Resolve aggregation
